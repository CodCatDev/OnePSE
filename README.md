## About
<img src="ReadmeRes/logo.png" width="100" align="left">
<b>OnePSE</b> is a free, open-source Python game engine using the SDL graphics engine.
This project is the work of two persons, so every star on Github is a huge incentive for its creator!

Initially, the project was conceived as a game on Sdl2, but soon, due to the complexity of Sdl2, this engine was born to simplify the work with this graphics engine.

This project is under active development. Therefore, it may receive lengthy but significant updates. We would be grateful if you contributed to the projec
